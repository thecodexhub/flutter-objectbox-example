Flutter project that shows how to work with ObjectBox - High Performance NoSQL Database.

This project shows - 
- how to persist data locally using [ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io/).
- how to use entities, relations, reactive queries, ordering, and other functionalities.
- how to maintain the codebase with proper architecture and state management techniques.
- how to effectively isolate the presentation layer from the business logic layer using [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc).
- how to inject single instances of repositories using RepositoryProvider.
- how to create forms with validated value objects rather than a primitive object type like String with [formz](https://pub.dev/packages/formz).
